     * * center: translate the coordinate origin to the center of the image
     * * -center: translate the coordinate origin back to the initial origin
     * * rotate=[angle]: rotate in X/Y plane (around Z-axis) by the given angle in degrees
     * * rotateX=[angle]: rotate in Y/Z plane (around X-axis) by the given angle in degrees
     * * rotateY=[angle]: rotate in X/Z plane (around Y-axis) by the given angle in degrees
     * * rotateZ=[angle]: rotate in X/Y plane (around Z-axis) by the given angle in degrees
     * * scale=[factor]: isotropic scaling according to given zoom factor
     * * scaleX=[factor]: scaling along X-axis according to given zoom factor
     * * scaleY=[factor]: scaling along Y-axis according to given zoom factor
     * * scaleZ=[factor]: scaling along Z-axis according to given zoom factor
     * * shearXY=[factor]: shearing along X-axis in XY plane according to given factor
     * * shearXZ=[factor]: shearing along X-axis in XZ plane according to given factor
     * * shearYX=[factor]: shearing along Y-axis in XY plane according to given factor
     * * shearYZ=[factor]: shearing along Y-axis in YZ plane according to given factor
     * * shearZX=[factor]: shearing along Z-axis in XZ plane according to given factor
     * * shearZY=[factor]: shearing along Z-axis in YZ plane according to given factor
     * * translateX=[distance]: translate along X-axis by distance given in pixels
     * * translateY=[distance]: translate along X-axis by distance given in pixels
     * * translateZ=[distance]: translate along X-axis by distance given in pixels
     * 
     * Example transform:
     * transform = "center scale=2 rotate=45 -center";
